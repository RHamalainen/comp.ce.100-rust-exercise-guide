# Exercise guide

We recommend `Visual Studio Code` (VSCode) to edit Rust source code.
It comes pre-installed on TC219 computers.
We also recommend you to use `rust-analyzer`-extension in VSCode.

This page is divided into the following subsections:
- [Register access](./1_register-access.md)
- [Special integer types](./2_bit-width.md)
- [LED-array](./3_leds-array.md)
- [Match-statement](./4_match.md)
- [Other things](./5_rust.md)

## Proceeding from here

After reading the above, the next step would be copy-pasting the C-code from your original alien shooter and translating it to Rust.
Next page contains more curosities that might be relevant for completing the exercise.
