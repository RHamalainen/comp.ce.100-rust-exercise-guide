## Match statements

Your C-code likely contains many `if-else` chains and `switch` cases. In Rust, these are both replaced by something called a [`match-statement`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/match.html). In the interrupt handlers, there are very good use cases for matching into binary numbers.

Use this information to re-write the game logic in main.rs, and possibly other files.
