# Exercise Guide

We recommend you use "Visual Studio Code" to edit Rust source code. This is because as of the time of writing, Visual Studio Code has the best support for Rust language tools. Visual Studio Code also comes pre-installed on the computers at TC219. We also recommend you use the "rust-analyzer" extension in VS Code, instead of the "rust" extension.

This page is divided into the following subsections:
- [Register Access](./1_register-access.md)
- [Special integer types](./2_bit-width.md)
- [Leds-Array](./3_leds-array.md)
- [Match-Statements](./4_match.md)
- [Other Rust things of note](./5_rust.md)

## Proceeding from here

With the above differences covered, the rest of the work should mostly consist of copy-pasting the C-code from the source, and adjusting based on compiler instructions. The next page of the guide contains some more curiosities that may or may not be relevant to completing the exercise.

There's also an in-depth Rust guide for embedded C programmers in the OpenTitan project: https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/rust_for_c/.
